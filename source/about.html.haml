    I'm currently a web developer for <a href="http://www.keen.io">keen.io</a>
    based in Denver, CO.
    I write mostly JavaScript these days, working mostly on Keen.io's
    <a href="https://github.com/keen/explorer"> Explorer</a> which is
    built on React. In my past life, I was a web consultant at
    <a href="https://thoughtbot.com"> thoughtbot</a>, focusing on Ruby on
    Rails, JavaScript, proper test driven development, and design patterns.

    Outside of work, I work a lot of D3.js and IPython notebook. I also enjoy
    experimenting with visualizations and creative programs.

    %li Best practices in software and web development
