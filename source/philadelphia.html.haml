  This is a visualization of all of the buses running in Philadelphia done with Processing.
  This was mostly inspired by [Eric Fischer's visualizations of San Francisco's Muni system](http://www.flickr.com/photos/walkingsf/4833097573/).

  I toyed around with several versions of this visualization. Here are some of my favorite
  results.
