title: How I organize my life

Last year, I discovered [bullet journaling](https://bulletjournal.com) for the first time.
Bullet journaling is a planner system developed by [Ryder Carrol](https://bulletjournal.com/).
If you're new to the concept, I highly recommend watching [his introduction video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fm15cmYU0IM). 
Carrol's method of bullet journaling is a method of notebook layouts and encoding tasks to help a person keep track of their short and long term goals.
It's helped me tremendously, but this method of journaling didn't work out exactly for me.
I want to document my method of planning and organization in case it can help someone else.
I hesitate to call this "bullet journaling" because it doesn't use much of Carrol's exact techniques, but definitely pulls in a lot influence from him and other bullet journalers online.

## "Goals"

As mentioned above, bullet journaling is a great way to organize long and short term goals.
However, I've stopped setting career goals, and my only priority for the time being is to take care of my health and set better boundaries.
In the last few years I've worked many late nights, sometimes juggling multiple jobs at once, ran meetups,
gave jet lagged talks around the world, gave up weekends, free time, and vacation time to
travel for conferences and mentor other developers, and pulled countless all-nighters to get it barely done.

While there are many reasons for this behavior that are too deep to go
into in this blog post, I realized I couldn't say no to people, and I didn't even have time figure out what I wanted in my own life.
The physical act of writing down a task and seeing it on paper next to all my other tasks for the week helps me realize how taxing saying "yes" can be
and reminds me to ask myself if that effort is worth it.
This has helped me set better boundaries in my life.

## One Notebook

Bullet journal layouts are designed for a dedicated notebook: a
table of contents, pages mapped out for months in advance, and so on.
I prefer not to juggle several notebooks, so I keep my work notes, personal notes, informal
sketches, and my bullet journal pages in one unruled notebook ([A5 double ring
Muji](https://www.muji.us/store/recycled-paper-double-rings-notebook-a5-plain-8a.html)).

## Weekly Spreads

<br />

Every Sunday, I divide a page into 6 boxes: one for each weekday, and the last for the weekend.
I look at my digital calendar for important work meetings, appointments, and anything else, and write down their date and time in the correct box.
Rather than encode my items using Carrol's bullet encoding system, I highlight to-dos and appointments in separate colors.
As more appointments, meetings, and invitations pile up on the week, I'll write them in and highlight accordingly.
When I need to run errands or do other tasks, work related or not, I'll create a checkbox.

_"But Joanne, isn't this what a calendar app is for?"_

Here are the reasons I prefer this method:
- I can't write notes about my meeting to myself in my calendar.
- I use Linux, which doesn't have an OS X equivalent calendar that I like. I need to juggle 4 different google calendars.
- My phone calendar is connected to my phone, a dangerously addictive device.

I'll occasionally also play around with the design of my weekly spread.
This gives me a bit of time every week to do a small creative thing solely for myself.

I purposely do one week at a time so I can leave the rest of the notebook empty for notes and writing throughout the week.

## Monthly tracking and planning

I've used countless habit tracking apps, and found that tracking habits using a physical tracker is the only thing that sticks. The goal of this page is to track my habits without judgment.
I didn't have any major goals with this page, however, after tracking my habits for the last two months, I'm now finally exercising and meditating almost every day.
My mood tracker (the bar graph above) is completely subjective, but it helps me be more aware of my emotional state.
If I notice I've been feeling bad for a few days in a row, I'll ask myself if I'm doing the things that help my emotional state and at least take steps to do something that makes me feel better about myself.

This month I tracked 5 habits, and next month, I'll probably only track exercise and meditation.
I learned that overwhelming oneself with new, healthy habits, isn't a good way to make them stick.

## Daily journaling

I set aside a few pages at the beginning of the month for focused journaling.
I'm doing a journaling exercise I heard from [Alex Banayan on The Ground Up
podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdSMbUi6Ct8&t=851s). The exercise
requires the writer to answer three questions: "what filled me with enthusiasm
today?", "what drained me of energy today?", and "what did I learn about myself
today?". This type of short, focused journaling has been helping me unpack my
thoughts and emotions, and I plan to continue creating layouts and space each
month for journaling exercises.

## Benefits

While this type of life organization hasn't cured my depression or stopped all my unhealthy life choices, it's helped nudge me towards healthier habits.
A weekly spread filled with too many to-dos reminds me that it's okay to say no to people,
writing a short journal entry helps me look at my thoughts from a different angle, and
looking at the doodles and designs I made makes me feel good that I created something just for myself.
This type of journaling has been like a mirror, it's given me a much better picture of my own life.
If you're feeling overwhelmed or unfocused, pick a pen and a notebook and look into bullet journaling.
