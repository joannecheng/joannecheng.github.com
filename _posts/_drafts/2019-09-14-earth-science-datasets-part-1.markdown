# Natural Disaster Data Sources

Here are some sources I've used when exploring patterns in natural disasters.
I'm hestitant to say that I "enjoy" exploring these types of data because many
of these natural disasters have resulted in very real damage to countless
people. I'm drawn to this topic because nature has a way of creating patterns
that can be a source for intriguing, haunting visualizations.

## National Hurricane Center Data

* [National Hurricane Center Data Archive](https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/data)

This blog post is being written during a destructive, deadly hurrican-
season. The [National Hurricane Center](https://www.nhc.noaa.gov).

There are Best Tracks (subjectively drawn locations and intensities) for
tropical cyclones all the way back to 1851. https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/data/#hurdat

There is also an archive of reports and previous advisories released for
each storm.

Japan has typhoon tracks from

## US Tornadoes, Hail, and Damaging Wind

https://www.spc.noaa.gov/wcm/ (Look for "Severe Weather Database Files")

Official tornadoes, hail, and damaging wind occurences from the 1950's to
today. Each severe weather event is in a straightforward, well documented
https://www.spc.noaa.gov/wcm/data/SPC_severe_database_description.pdf csv
file.

Through exploration, one can see that the strongest tornadoes usually happen
in May in the middle of the continental US. Tornadoes also happen in the
south later in the year.

## Real-time Earthquakes

The data feed is updated frequently, available in many formats, and well
documented.

When I was doing analysis on Earthquakes in Taiwan, I found many smaller
earthquakes in Taiwan were omitted from the USGS feed. I used Taiwan Central
Weather Bureau's Earthquake Report https://www.cwb.gov.tw/V7e/earthquake/ as
a source. I also use the Japan Meteorlogical Agency site
http://www.jma.go.jp/en/quake/quake_singendo_index.html for earthquakes in
Japan (also available as a twitter feed: https://twitter.com/EarthquakesJA)


## One last note:

Many of these natural disasters have resulted in fatalities and long-lasting
financial and emotional damage to affected people. Researching the effects
of these disasters on populations helps us gain some sensitivity when
finding ways to present the data that doesn't minimalize the human effects
of these events.
