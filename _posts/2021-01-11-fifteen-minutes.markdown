# 15 Minutes of Nothing

Whenever I feel unproductive and unable to work, I follow a piece of advice I've heard many times before: take a short break away from the computer, return, set a timer for 15 minutes and work until the timer runs out. Sometimes I'll feel motivated to keep working, sometimes I'll need to stop and repeat this process or admit defeat for the day. At the very least, since I focused during those 15 minutes, I know I did _something_ with my time. Usually, the hardest part of working is getting started.

Since the pandemic started, I've had trouble disconnecting from news sites and social media. Like many others, screens provided some distraction from the isolation, the boredom, and it helped us stay connected to the dramatic political news. It was hard to feel rested during nonworking hours.

I've started following the same advice for my rest time. When I feel myself in an internet or screen-time loop, I shut my devices off, set a timer, and do anything not involving a screen. While meditation is a recommended practice for screen addiction, this is not meditation. This is a gentle push away from the screen to encourage myself to enjoy the world around me, much like we used to do before we were confined to our homes. Usually I'll start cleaning, go for a walk, or working on a craft project I've been neglecting. When the timer runs out, sometimes I'll go back to the screen, but lately I've been trying to nudge myself to keep doing whatever I was doing for a little longer. But I'm always happy I stepped away for a moment.
