Bullet journaling is a planner system developed by [Ryder Carrol](https://bulletjournal.com/).
If you're new to the concept, I highly recommend watching [his introduction video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fm15cmYU0IM).

Carrol's method of planning is simple and a huge improvement for me, someone who gets easily overwhelmed and has trouble staying focused on long term goals.
I've experimented with bullet journaling for the past year, and while Carrol's method didn't work out exactly for me, I want to document my method of planning and organization in case it can help someone else.
I hesitate to call this "bullet journaling" because it doesn't use much of Carrol's exact techniques, but definitely pulls in a lot influence from him and other bullet journalers online.

## One Notebook

Most bullet journal layouts seem to be designed for dedicated notebook.
I keep my work notes, personal notes, informal sketches, and my bullet journal pages in one unruled notebook (A5 double ring Muji).
I use journaling to keep track of my work tasks, personal errands, and mental health and found it much easier to keep everything in one place.

## Weekly Spreads

Every Sunday, I divide a page into 6 boxes: one for each weekday, and the last for the weekend.
I look at my digital calendar for important work meetings, appointments, and anything else, and write down their date and time in the correct box.

As more appointments, meetings, and invitations pile up on the week, I'll write them in.
When I need to run errands or do other tasks, work related or not, I'll create a checkbox.

Some people have asked why I don't use my phone or computer's calendar app. Here are the reasons I prefer this method:
- I can't write notes about my meeting to myself in my calendar.
- I use Linux, which doesn't have an OS X equivalent calendar that I like. I need to juggle 4 different google calendars.
- My phone calendar is connected to my phone, a dangerously addictive device.

I'll also play around with the design of my weekly spread, usually pulling inspiration from designers of other mediums.
This gives me a bit of time every week to tap into my creative brain and make something solely for myself.

I purposely do one week at a time so I can leave the rest of the notebook empty for notes, since I don't have multiple notebooks.

## Monthly tracking and planning

I've used countless habit tracking apps, and found that tracking habits using a physical tracker is the only thing that sticks.


My advice? If you're serious about building good habits, don't add more than one habit to track a month.

## Daily journaling

I'm doing a journaling exercise I heard from Alex Banayan on The Ground Up podcast (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdSMbUi6Ct8&t=851s).
I purposely left the spaces very small to make sure I write a little bit every day.
In the future, I'd like to leave at least half a page a day for more indepth writing.
