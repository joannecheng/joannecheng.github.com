<h2>Keen IO Explorer</h2>

<div class="f6">
  <p>
    The Keen IO Explorer is an interface our team built to allow customers
    to visualize the data they stored on the Keen IO platform.

    The Explorer allowed users to view the streams they created, run
    queries, visualize data in various dimensions,
    and manage saved/cached queries on their account.

    The query's graphs also generated a embeddable JavaScript snippet
    so users could embed the graph anywhere they want.

    The application was used often by our customers,
    as displayed in the Explorer query below.

    Keen IO employees also used the Explorer interally on a daily basis
    to share important engineering and customer metrics.

  <p>
    A major problem we dealt with during development was
    handling of datasets with many attributes.
    For example, a "Group By" query returns results grouped by
    a selected field. Often times, the number of unique
    field values would be very large.
    The Explorer uses
    <a href="http://c3js.org/">C3.js</a>
    to generate the graphs that displays Keen data.
    C3.js would cause our graph labels to
    get cut off when there were too many group-by values to display.

    Below is the solution we designed and developed to paginate our
    legends and data when we couldn't display all groups in one graph.
  </p>

    <img
      class="pb2"
      src="/assets/img/explorer/paginated-metrics.png"
      title="Using Explorer to display Explorer stats."
      alt="Using Explorer to display Explorer stats.">
    </img>

  <p>
    11 groups would be displayed at once, and the user would be able to
    flip through various "pages" of groups.
    The entire data set returned from the query is still visible on the
    graph, but they are greyed out to avoid any confusion.
    This allowed us to accurately display all the data returned from the
    query, while still allowing the user to focus on the data displayed on the
    current "page."
  </p>

  <p>
    The project was built with React with ES6 JavaScript, and the source code
    is available
    <a href="https://github.com/keen/explorer">
    on GitHub</a>.
