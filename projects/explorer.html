<h2>Keen IO Explorer</h2>

<div class="f6">
  <p>
    The Keen IO Explorer is an interface our team built to allow customers
    to visualize the data they stored on the Keen IO platform.

    The Explorer allowed users to view the streams they created, run
    queries, visualize data in various dimensions,
    and manage saved/cached queries on their account.

    The query's graphs also generated a embeddable JavaScript snippet
    so users could embed the graph anywhere they want.

    The application was used often by our customers,
    as displayed in the Explorer query below.

  <p>
    Keen IO employees also used the Explorer interally on a daily basis
    to share important engineering and customer metrics.

    A major problem we dealt with during development was
    handling of datasets with many attributes.
    The Explorer uses
    <a href="http://c3js.org/">C3.js</a>
    to generate the graphs that displays Keen data.
    Unfortunately, C3.js would cause our graph labels to
    get cut off when there were too many sets of data to display.

    Below is the solution we designed and developed to paginate our
    legends and data when we couldn't display all groups in one graph.

  <p>
    The project was built with React with ES6 JavaScript, and the source code
    is available
    <a href="https://github.com/keen/explorer">
    on GitHub</a>.
