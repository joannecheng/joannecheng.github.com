<h2>Grid Map</h2>

<div class="f6">

    <a href="https://github.com/joannecheng/grid_map">grid-map
    </a>
    is a personal project that is a solution
    for displaying a dense number of points in d3.js map visualizations.

  <p>
    I used tornado data from NOAA's
    <a href="http://www.spc.noaa.gov/wcm/">
      Storm Prediction Center
    </a>
    page and plotted all tornadoes from 2005 to 2014 using d3.js.
    The result looked like this:

  <section class="center pt2 pb4 mw7">
    <img
      class="pb2"
      src="/assets/img/grid-map/tornadoes-aggregated-before.png"
      title="All tornadoes from 2005-2014"
      alt="All tornadoes from 2005-2014" />

    <div class="f7 i tc">
      Displaying all tornadoes from 2005 to 2014. That's a lot of points.
    </div>
  </section>

  <p>
    I used D3's <a href="https://github.com/d3/d3-quadtree">QuadTree</a> to
    help me calculate the number of points in a "cell."
    Based on that number,
    I filled in that cell with the correct intensity of color (the darker the
    cell, the more points there are in that cell).
