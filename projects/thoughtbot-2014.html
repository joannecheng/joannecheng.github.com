<h2>
  thoughtbot 2014 report
</h2>

<div class="f6">
  <p>
    I was inspired by beautiful end-of-year reports I saw other companies release in December/January,
    detailing the important stats of their company.
    In 2013, I created an internal "report" during
    <a href="https://thoughtbot.com">thoughtbot's</a> that created amusing stats about our
    company's chat habits. I wanted to create something public in 2014.
  </p>

  <p>
    I worked on a team with coworkers <a href="https://github.com/JoelQ">Joel</a> and <a href="https://github.com/gabebw">Gabe</a>,
    who helped collect data about our blog post content.
    I wanted to show our most popular blog posts that year in a creative way and designed the visualization below.
  </p>

      class="pb2 center"
      src="/assets/img/thoughtbot-2014/blogauthors.png"
      title="thoughtbot's most popular blog posts in 2014"
      alt="thoughtbot's most popular blog posts in 2014" />

    <div class="f7 i tc">
      thoughtbot's most popular blog posts in 2014
    </div>
  </section>

  <p>
    Each circle represents a blog post, the size of the circle represents the number
    of views the post got.
    The posts are all grouped by author.
    I was surprised that our most popular blog posts were about our testing practices,
    command line tools like sed and awk, and our git workflow.
    These are tools and practices that I didn't think needed explanations because were so
    ingrained into my workflow, but I was definitely wrong!

    I was also proud of the D3.js animation I made showing the distances traveled
    by our employees to give conference talks.
    The starting location is each speaker's home office location, the ending location is the city of the conference.
