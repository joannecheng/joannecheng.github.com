  I love playing around with natural earth data and was inspired by
  <a href="https://blog.cartodb.com/mapping-nexrad-radar-data/">this blog post by CartoDB</a> to map NOAA NEXRAD data using technologies I use often: JavaScript, Python, and D3.js.
  </p>

  <p>
    The original blog post explains how to retrieve the data from S3 and also provided a script to export a CSV file containing radar coordinates from the compressed radar files.
    If you want a better understanding of the about the radar file formats and the original Python script, I highly recommend reading the original post.
  </p>

  <p>I displayed base reflectivity, which can be explained

    here</a>.
  <a href="https://eng.climate.com/2015/10/27/how-to-read-and-display-nexrad-on-aws-using-python/">This blog post by The Climate Corporation</a> provides an informative guide to working with NEXRAD data with Python.
  </p>

  <p>
    Rather than use SVG to display each reflectivity value at a specific location, I used Canvas for faster
    rendering, since I knew each radar scan had many points I needed to display.
    This was my first attempt using Canvas instead of SVG, and I learned that D3.js v4.0 has great support
    for drawing Canvas objects.

  <p>
    This project is not finished yet.
    My next goal is to find better ways to compress the CSVs of the radar scans and display different radar levels.
