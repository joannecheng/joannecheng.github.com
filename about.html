<h2>Hello!</h2>
<div class="f6">
  <p>I'm currently a freelance developer who is excited about data analysis, data visualization, and machine learning.
  I write a lot of Python and JavaScript, but I also toy around with Clojure and Java.
  </p>

  <p>I was previously at
  <a href="https://keen.io">Keen IO</a> and
  <a href="https://thoughtbot.com">thoughtbot</a>,
  where I mostly wrote Python, Ruby, and JavaScript.
  </p>

  <p>
    I currently live in Denver, Colorado, but I tend to travel around a lot.
  </p>

  <p>
    When I'm not coding, I am usually dancing, choreographing in my head, climbing things,
    reading about meteorology, biking around, hiking in the mountains, or cooking.
  </p>

  Feel free to email me at joannecheng.developer at gmail.com if you'd like to chat!
