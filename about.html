<h2>Hello!</h2>
<div class="f6">
  <p>I'm currently a freelance developer who is excited about data analysis, data visualization, and machine learning.
  I work mostly in Python and JavaScript and occasionally Clojure and Java.
  </p>

  <p>I was previously at
  <a href="https://keen.io">Keen IO</a>, where I was on the Web Experience team.
  My responsibilities included developing and designing user-facing applications
  on the <a href="https://keen.io">Keen IO</a> website and Keen IO's
  billing system.

  Before that, I worked as a Rails and JavaScript consultant at
  <a href="https://thoughtbot.com">thoughtbot</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    I currently live in Denver, Colorado.
  </p>

  <p>
    Aside from computers, I enjoy dancing, climbing things, travel, reading about meteorology,
    biking, exploring mountains, and cooking.
  </p>
